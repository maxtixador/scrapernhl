# ANNOUNCEMENT: Version 0.1.5 Released
*Date: February 1st, 2026*

Hello, fellow hockey analytics enthusiasts!
I am thrilled to announce the release of version 0.1.5 of the scraper package!

If in the latest update (v0.1.4), we focused on usability (modularization, documentation, CLI), this time the emphasis has been on enhancing the core functionality of the scraper itself.

Summary of improvements in this release:
1. **Migrate legacy code** → Better maintenance
2. **Add player stats scraper** → Complete feature set  
3. **Improve caching** → Better performance
4. **Add batch scraping** → User convenience
5. **Add validation** → Data reliability
6. **Standardize errors** → Better debugging
7. **Rich integration** → Increased developer engagement
8. **Enhance logging** → Easier issue tracking
9. **Visualisation functions** → Quick insights
10. **Aggregation functions** → Simplified analysis
