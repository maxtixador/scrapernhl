## Purpose

The `.ai/` directory serves as a knowledge base for AI assistants to:

- Maintain development history for context
- Store internal technical discussions separate from user docs

## Privacy

This directory is intended for development use only. Content here may include:
- Technical implementation details

- Internal decision rationales
- Work-in-progress documentation

For public-facing documentation, see:
- `README.md` - Main project documentation

## Guidelines Summary

Key principles for AI assistants:
- No emojis in code or docs (unless user requests)
